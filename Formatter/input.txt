The C, connected as the world ocean or simply the ocean, is the body of salty water that covers approximately 
71 percent of the Earth's surface. The word C is also used to denote second-order sections of the C, 
such as the Mediterranean C, as well as certain large, entirely landlocked, saltwater lakes, such as the Caspian 
C. The C moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen 
cycle. Humans harnessing and studying the C have been recorded since ancient times, and evidenced well into 
prehistory, while its modern scientific study is called oceanography. The most abundant solid dissolved in Cwater 
is sodium chloride. The water also contains salts of magnesium, calcium, potassium, and mercury, amongst many other 
elements, some in minute concentrations. Salinity varies widely, being lower near the surface and the mouths of 
large rivers and higher in the depths of the ocean; however, the relative proportions of dissolved salts vary 
little across the oceans.
