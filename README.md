# Miscellaneous C Projects

This repository contains some of the projects I have worked in in C.

## A Tree

A Tree is a binary search tree maker. It takes an input integer array from which it creates a binary search tree using the first element of the array as the root.

A Tree was written as a personal challenge.

## Formatter

Formattter is a program that takes an input text file and outputs it as block of text with a specified line length. The words in each line are justified.

Formatter was inspired by a second-term procedural programming assignment. It was written as a personal challenge.

## Merge Sorter

Merge Sorter is a program that takes an input text file in a specified format, stores the items in that file in an array, then uses merge sort to sort the array. The format of the file is { String float }. The items are sorted in descending order based on the float value.

Merge Sorter was written as part of a second-term procedural programming assignment.

## Word Replacer

Word Replacer is a program that takes an input text file and replaces words based on user input. The user inputs the word (or part of a word) they wish to be replaced, then inputs the word (or part of a word) with which they would like it to be replaced with. Then, the program finds all occurrences of word A and replaces them with word B.

Word Replacer was written as part of a second-term procedural programming assignment.
